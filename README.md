# Python Pentest Scripts
Some small and simple python scripts that might help with pentesting/CTFs. 
All of them except pingsweep.py probably require you to view the code before using them (argument order matters)

- `pingsweep.py` -> Sweeps an IP range(CIDR) or a list of IPs, starts multiple threads with subprocess.Popen(). Thread limit is **NOT** implemented yet
- `ssh_bruteforce.py` -> Takes a target IP, a wordlist and an username. Attempts to bruteforce SSH access. Modify code to change commands that are executed on a sucessful connection
- `port_scanner.py` -> Scans an IP for opened ports. Modify the ports variable 
- `hash_crack.py` -> Takes a wordlist and a hash to attempt to find the password. Code can be modified to use different a hashing algorithm
- `directory_enum.py` -> Takes a wordlist and an IP/Domain and checks for existing files/directories, also appending extensions. 
- `subdomain_enum.py` -> Takes a wordlist and an IP/down and checks for subdomains
- `download_file.py` -> A sample script to showcase downloading a file with python
